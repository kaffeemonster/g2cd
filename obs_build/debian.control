Description: A G2 Hub only implementation
 This is a server-only implementation for the Gnutella 2 P2P-protocol.
 Gnutella and Gnutella 2 are self-organizing, "server-less" P2P-networks.
 But, to maintain network-connectivity, some network nodes become,
 dynamicaly, special nodes (Ultra-peers/Hubs).
 The main idea behind this piece of software is to be able to set up a
 dedicated Gnutella 2 Hub to maintain the G2 network connectivity.  With
 its ability to run on a typical server grade machine (UNIXÂ® system /
 24-7 / static IP / high Bandwidth / SMP), it will hopefully be able to
 improve the overall Gnutella 2 performance.
