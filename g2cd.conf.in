COMMENTC Example config file for g2cd
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC In here you will find config options for g2cd, with a little
COMMENTC explanation what they are good for and what is their default.
COMMENTC The default is normaly written behind the option, but sometimes
COMMENTC a more complex mechanism defines the default. Please refer
COMMENTC to the explanation of the option in such cases.

COMMENTC Unix server stuff
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENTC do we want to fork to the background?
COMMENTC
COMMENT be_daemon = DEFAULT_BE_DAEMON

COMMENTC
COMMENTC do we want to provide services over IPv4?
COMMENTC
COMMENT use_ipv4 = DEFAULT_USE_IPV4

COMMENTC
COMMENTC do we want to provide services over IPv6
COMMENTC
COMMENT use_ipv6 = DEFAULT_USE_IPV6

COMMENTC
COMMENTC What is the user account we want to run under
COMMENTC
COMMENT user_name = DEFAULT_USER


COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC G2 server stuff
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENTC What is the GUID we are known by?
COMMENTC A G2 Node has a "uniqe" GUID it is known by. The GUID is
COMMENTC used for some basic tasks by the network, for example
COMMENTC packet routing.
COMMENTC It is generly advisable to set a fixed GUID so your hub
COMMENTC can be reidentified.
COMMENTC
COMMENTC If you do not set a fixed GUID, a random one will be
COMMENTC generated on every start.
COMMENTC
COMMENTC The format is:
COMMENTC ABCDEF01-2345-6789-ABCD-EF0123456789
COMMENTC
COMMENT our_guid = <random>

COMMENTC
COMMENTC How many connections do we want to accept?
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC WARNING:
COMMENTC Please make sure your enviroment (ulimits, RAM, connection
COMMENTC bandwith, kernel, CPU) can sustain such a number of
COMMENTC connections.
COMMENTC Esp. make sure that the number of max. open file descriptors
COMMENTC is configured large enough for the user account we run under.
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENT max_connection_sum = DEFAULT_CON_MAX

COMMENTC
COMMENTC How many Inter Hub connections we want to accept?
COMMENTC This defines how many other hubs will be allowed to connect
COMMENTC to us. Do not set this number to high. A rule of thumb is
COMMENTC 2 per 300 connections, with a limit at ???.
COMMENTC
COMMENT max_hub_sum        = DEFAULT_HUB_MAX

COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC Profile stuff
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENTC What is our nick name?
COMMENTC It will be exposed on profile requests and to the crawler.
COMMENTC
COMMENTC The default is the hostname of this maschine.
COMMENTC
COMMENTC Note that this nick name will always be send to the crawler.
COMMENTC If you do not want to expose the hostname, CHANGE this.
COMMENTC
COMMENT nick_name = <hostname>

COMMENTC
COMMENTC Do we want to answer profile requests?
COMMENTC To not run into compatibility trouble, we send something.
COMMENTC
COMMENT profile_want_2_send = DEFAULT_SEND_PROFILE

COMMENTC
COMMENTC The latitude/longitude put into the profile.
COMMENTC This gives your position on the world so it
COMMENTC can be decided if you are near to someone and
COMMENTC the crawler can draw nice maps.
COMMENTC The coordinates are in WGS84 (aka GPS) in shorthand
COMMENTC decimal notation (aka Decimal degrees with negative
COMMENTC numbers for South and West)
COMMENTC See maps.google or Wikipedia for coordinates of
COMMENTC your position.
COMMENTC
COMMENT profile_latitude = DEFAULT_PROFILE_LAT
COMMENT profile_longitude = DEFAULT_PROFILE_LONG

COMMENTC
COMMENTC The country put into the profile
COMMENTC
COMMENT profile_country = DEFAULT_PROFILE_COUNTRY

COMMENTC
COMMENTC The city put into the profile
COMMENTC
COMMENT profile_city = DEFAULT_PROFILE_CITY

COMMENTC
COMMENTC The state put into the profile
COMMENTC
COMMENT profile_state = DEFAULT_PROFILE_STATE

COMMENTC
COMMENTC Do we want to send a complete list of connected clients
COMMENTC on crawler request?
COMMENTC Note that this has the potential to generate some traffic
COMMENTC on high connection count since we can only protect our self
COMMENTC with a timeout.
COMMENTC
COMMENT crawl_send_clients = DEFAULT_NICK_SEND_CLIENTS

COMMENTC
COMMENTC Do we want to send our GPS position (see profile) on
COMMENTC crawler request?
COMMENTC
COMMENT crawl_send_gps = DEFAULT_NICK_SEND_GPS

COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC Misc stuff
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENTC The number of worker threads we are going to spawn.
COMMENTC 0 means autodetect == number of cpus
COMMENTC
COMMENTC Note: There will be additional threads to the number
COMMENTC       configured.
COMMENTC
COMMENT num_threads = DEFAULT_NUM_THREADS

COMMENTC
COMMENTC Where do we read some bytes from to seed our PRNG?
COMMENTC
COMMENT entropy_source = DEFAULT_ENTROPY_SOURCE

COMMENTC
COMMENTC The root dir where g2cd can save persistent files
COMMENTC
COMMENT data_root_dir = DEFAULT_DATA_ROOT_DIR

COMMENTC
COMMENTC The file name of our Known Hub List dump
COMMENTC
COMMENT khl_dump_filename = DEFAULT_KHL_DUMP

COMMENTC
COMMENTC The file name of our GUID dump
COMMENTC
COMMENT guid_dump_filename = DEFAULT_GUID_DUMP

COMMENTC
COMMENTC The file name of our Gnutella Web Cache DB
COMMENTC
COMMENT gwc_cache_filename = DEFAULT_GWC_DB

COMMENTC
COMMENTC Our Gnutella Web Cache boot URL
COMMENTC This URL is first inserted into your DB and never removed.
COMMENTC
COMMENT gwc_boot_url = DEFAULT_GWC_BOOT

COMMENTC
COMMENTC How much should we adjust our niceness?
COMMENTC
COMMENT nice_adjust = DEFAULT_NICE_ADJUST

COMMENTC
COMMENTC Should we add timestamps to our logging messages?
COMMENTC
COMMENT log_add_date_time = DEFAULT_LOG_ADD_TIME

COMMENTC
COMMENTC Which format to use for our timestamps?
COMMENTC
COMMENTC If you leave this field unset (NULL), we will use
COMMENTC our fast time stamp printer (avoiding some conversions
COMMENTC and overhead), which will output something like
COMMENTC "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" or "2010-05-23T23:56:21Z" in "UNIX"
COMMENTC time (which is some seconds near UTC).
COMMENTC
COMMENTC If you set the format, output will be in localtime, see
COMMENTC "man strftime" for details how to format the output.
COMMENTC A typical format often used by logger is "%b %d %H:%M:%S"
COMMENTC
COMMENT log_time_date_format = DEFAULT_LOG_TIME_FORMAT

COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC Connection compression
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENTC The G2 protocol demands the availability of the deflate
COMMENTC compression algorithm from zlib.
COMMENTC It can be used on several items:
COMMENTC  - compressing QHT patches when send on the wire
COMMENTC  - UDP traffic
COMMENTC  - TCP connections
COMMENTC The first use is a big win. Also the first and second usage
COMMENTC cannot be influenced by us when receiving.
COMMENTC
COMMENTC But the third use can and should...
COMMENTC
COMMENTC Connection compresison yields around 20% to 40% compression.
COMMENTC This is nice (for low bandwidth), but comes at a price:
COMMENTC  - CPU usage
COMMENTC  - RAM usage
COMMENTC While most people think of CPU usage when they hear compression,
COMMENTC actually the RAM usage is our concern.
COMMENTC
COMMENTC On the other occassions (UDP, QHT), we do not need to carry any
COMMENTC compression state across invocations, so we can use one static
COMMENTC deflater & inflater. This means the RAM-usage is fixed (actually
COMMENTC by the number of threads, every thread has one, but i do not
COMMENTC think you own an SGI Altix with 1024 CPUs...). No problem.
COMMENTC
COMMENTC To the contrary on connection compresison, we need to keep the
COMMENTC compression state between received/send packets for every single
COMMENTC compressed connection.
COMMENTC This scales with the number of connections!!
COMMENTC
COMMENTC For most applications this state is small, because they only have
COMMENTC one or two compression streams. For us, as a hub, with lots of
COMMENTC connections, that state size is lethal. On Intel 32Bit:
COMMENTC  - inbound compression needs around 77kib
COMMENTC  - outbound compression needs around 266kib
COMMENTC So for 300 connections you need:
COMMENTC  300 * (77 + 266) = 100.4 Mib
COMMENTC plus overhead, plus CPU...
COMMENTC
COMMENTC That outbound compression is that expensive hurts the most,
COMMENTC because with that much connections our outbound bandwidth is
COMMENTC very stressed. Compression would be good. Also the default
COMMENTC setting for inbound compression on the clients (which is our
COMMENTC outbound bandwidth) is mostly off, instead clients have
COMMENTC outbound compression enabled (our inbound) to save bandwidth
COMMENTC on the client side. But if a client can not afford 3 _outgoing_
COMMENTC hub connections (which uses as much outgoing bandwidth as the
COMMENTC _client_ is active, doing searches etc., compared to the client
COMMENTC inbond, which gets packets shoved down the pipe involuntarily
COMMENTC on search hits by us), he maybe should not connect to the
COMMENTC network at all. It is all kind of the wrong way round (hub
COMMENTC outbound needed but to expensive, hub inbound unnecessary
COMMENTC so also to expensive), but the best we have...
COMMENTC Ban asymmetric connections...
COMMENTC
COMMENTC The only lucky thing is: Compression on TCP connections is
COMMENTC handshaked, both sides have to agree on the outbound and
COMMENTC inbound compression method separately.
COMMENTC This way we can at least force no compression to save our
COMMENTC recources (ok, besides bandwidth).
COMMENTC
COMMENTC This handshake is known as encoding handshake.
COMMENTC The next two settings let you configure what encoding should
COMMENTC be advertised by default on any tcp connection.
COMMENTC Possible values are:
COMMENTC  ENC_NONE    - no encoding
COMMENTC  ENC_DEFLATE - zlib compression
COMMENTC
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC Note:
COMMENTC This is the value that gets _advertised_, one can not force
COMMENTC an encoding besided ENC_NONE. The handshake will not fail
COMMENTC (most the time), instead no encoding will be used. So do
COMMENTC not calculate with a fixed bandwidth saving.
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC WARNING:
COMMENTC The default is to turn compression off, for "good reasons".
COMMENTC Outbound compression is rare, and you should have enough
COMMENTC bandwidth to sustain hub use anyway, because hubs are in
COMMENTC general multiplying traffic. Before you enable compression,
COMMENTC make _SURE_ you have enough RAM (esp. with respect to
COMMENTC other programms) and CPU to handle compression for the
COMMENTC number of configured connections.
COMMENTC If you will go into swap, you are toast.
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENT encoding_default_in  = DEFAULT_ENC_IN
COMMENT encoding_default_out = DEFAULT_ENC_OUT

COMMENTC
COMMENTC While all the above sounds quite gloomy, there is a bright side:
COMMENTC Connections to other hubs.
COMMENTC You (should) only have a hand full of hub connections,
COMMENTC and a good portion of your traffic goes to other hubs.
COMMENTC Hubs are normaly configured to handshake compression on
COMMENTC connections to other hubs, in- and outbound.
COMMENTC "And there was great rejoice"
COMMENTC Spending the RAM/CPU on hub connections is sustainable and
COMMENTC a clear win, so compression is advertised by default.
COMMENTC
COMMENTC If you are thin on RAM/CPU but have spare bandwidth, you
COMMENTC can disable compression to other hubs.
COMMENTC
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC Note:
COMMENTC The other end connected to you may _not_ have spare
COMMENTC bandwidth, if you disable this, you are hurting the
COMMENTC hubs connected to you.
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENT encoding_hub_in  = DEFAULT_HUB_ENC_IN
COMMENT encoding_hub_out = DEFAULT_HUB_ENC_OUT

COMMENTC More misc stuff
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENTC Most of these options are only listed for completness,
COMMENTC changing them is
COMMENTC
COMMENTC  N O T
COMMENTC
COMMENTC recommended.
COMMENTC -----------------------------------------------
COMMENTC
COMMENTC Should we compress our internal QHTs?
COMMENTC This will use more CPU, but saves a lot of RAM so you
COMMENTC should say yes here.
COMMENTC Do not confuse this compression with the zlib compression
COMMENTC from above.
COMMENTC
COMMENT qht_compress_internal = DEFAULT_QHT_COMPRESS_INTERNAL

COMMENTC
COMMENTC QHT-too-full ignore threshold.
COMMENTC A too full QHT is bad, because it matches too much, and lets the
COMMENTC false positives skyrocket. This creates a lot of search hits and
COMMENTC forwards (traffic) but no usefull results.
COMMENTC This can be seen as spam. This happens when either someone
COMMENTC shares too much files or there is really a spammer.
COMMENTC While one maybe want one of the files from the "shares to much"-
COMMENTC guy, this is not healthy for the network, only making the spammer
COMMENTC grin and prop. overloading the network connection of the guy
COMMENTC sharing to much.
COMMENTC So we ignore QHTs which are filled more than qht_max_promille
COMMENTC (divide by 10 and you have percent).
COMMENTC Note: Values larger 1000 disable this filter
COMMENTC
COMMENT qht_max_promille = DEFAULT_QHT_MAX_PROMILLE

COMMENTC
COMMENTC What is the maximal accepted packet size?
COMMENTC You should _NEVER_ raise this value, dragons be there...
COMMENTC
COMMENT max_g2_packet_length = DEFAULT_PCK_LEN_MAX
